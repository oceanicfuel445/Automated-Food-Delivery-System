**Automated Food Delivery Bot**

This project features an automated food delivery bot designed to streamline and enhance the food ordering experience. Powered by Arduino for precise movement and navigation, the bot employs obstacle-detection sensors to autonomously find and follow a clear path, avoiding any barriers along its route.

Using OpenCV for facial recognition, the bot identifies a customer, captures their details, records their order, and securely stores their facial data. Once the order is confirmed, the bot autonomously travels to the food truck to pick it up. On returning, it verifies the customer by matching their face against the stored data. If a match is detected, the customer can receive their order; if a stranger is detected, the bot denies the order transfer, ensuring both security and order accuracy.

This project integrates robotics, computer vision, and IoT for a seamless, autonomous food delivery solutionâ€”an innovative step toward contactless service in food delivery.
